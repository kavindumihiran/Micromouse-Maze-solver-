# Micromouse-Maze-solver-
# Description 
This repository contains the code for a maze-solving robot built with an Arduino Uno and ultrasonic sensors. The robot autonomously navigates and solves mazes by detecting walls and making real-time decisions to map the whole maze. The project demonstrates effective use of sensor feedback, a PID controller, and efficient maze exploration algorithms. The speciality is this maze robot does not have any encoders. It uses sensor feedback to stay at its path.

# Features 
* Ultrasonic Sensor Integration: Equipped with front, left, and right sensors to detect walls and maintain accurate navigation.
* PID Controller: Ensures smooth turns and precise alignment, enabling the robot to handle complex maze structures.
* Real-Time Decision Making: Implements logic for detecting paths
* Modular Design: Easily adaptable for different maze configurations and complexities.

# How to Use
1. Setup: Assemble the maze-solving robot with an Arduino Uno, ultrasonic sensors, and motor drivers. Ensure all components are wired as per the schematics.
2. Upload Code: Clone this repository, open the main .ino file in the Arduino IDE, and upload it to your Arduino Uno.
3. Run: Place the robot at the mazeâ€™s starting point and power it on. The robot will autonomously navigate and solve the maze using sensor feedback and implemented algorithms.
